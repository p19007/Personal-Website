  <center><p>I was born in Cambridge on 9th November 2005 and lived in Cambridge for a few months. Then, my dad got a job out in Vancouver, Canada and we moved out there for a year. I remember none of it but feel lucky to have gone - Vancouver has some stunning landscapes!
  Then we moved back to Cambridge when I was 1 Â½ and stayed there for a few years. Then, we moved down to Dorset and I started school. I went to Colehill First School for 4 years and then moved to Dumpton School until I was 13. Then, I joined Canford School where I will be going into 5th Form (Year 11) next year.
