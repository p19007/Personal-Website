    <center><p>I love playing music and have done since I started playing piano at age 7. I took up saxophone a year later but didnâ€™t start playing the flute until I was 12 - my saxophone teacher also taught flute so I started playing for fun and loved it so much I kept going! I am grade 7 in piano, grade 5 in flute and will be taking my grade 8 saxophone in a few months. I am very lucky to be able to play in lots of musical groups at school on my saxophone. I am a member of the Jazz Band which allows me to hone my improvisation skills and learn new music and played as a member of the Show Band for the school musical Chicago in my first year at Canford which was an enormous amount of fun and let me explore playing soprano (smaller) and tenor (bigger) saxophones as well as my alto. </p></center>
