    <center><p>I like crocheting to relax. Iâ€™m not particularly good at knitting and so when I was introduced to crochet, I fell in love with it (only one hook and no needles!). My favourite things to crochet are amigurumi or figures crocheted in circles. I like to crochet soft toys and so far have made three big ones - two bunnies and a fox. </p></center>

      <center><p> The bunny I crocheted for my grandad. He is wearing a pirate costume because my grandad used to call himself Captain Flint when my cousins and I were little.</p></center>

      width = "397.5"
      height = "532.5" 
      />
      <center><p> The second bunny I crocheted - she looks different to the other two as she is made from a different pattern - this meant I had to make up the pattern for her clothes as I went along.</p></center>
