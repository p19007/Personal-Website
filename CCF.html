    <center><p>CCF stands for Combined Cadet Force and at Canford, they offer Army Cadets, Navy Cadets or the Royal Marines Cadets. As I like a challenge and the Royal Marines was the only one with a selection course, I opted for them. Fortunately, I got in and since then have enjoyed all the opportunities CCF provides. Despite the pandemic, we have still achieved a lot this year and I have completed River Runs (complete with press ups in the river), Stretcher Runs (with a 40kg dummy), Assault Courses, Section Actions, Camouflage and Concealment, Rifle Firing, First Aid and much more. We were lucky enough to go on a Whole Day Enterprise (WDE) trip to Bovington Camp last term as well and despite the torrential rain and mud, I loved it. Iâ€™m looking forward to learning how to become an NCO (non-commissioned officer) next year and command new cadets as well as hopefully competing in the national inter-CCF Pringle Trophy. </p></center>
